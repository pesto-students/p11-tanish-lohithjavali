            <p>
                Bangalore has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate
                classification Aw) with distinct wet and dry seasons. Due to its high
                elevation, Bangalore usually enjoys a more moderate climate throughout
                the year, with its parks and green spaces earning it the reputation as
                the "Garden City" of India. Although occasional heat waves can make
                summer somewhat uncomfortable.
